# Java Hololive Schedule Parser
Simple code that allows you to get data from https://schedule.hololive.tv/ into Java. This is done through the use of [holo-schedule-CLI](https://github.com/TeepaBlue/holo-schedule-CLI) by TeepaBlue which parses the info from Hololive's website.

This code simply writes the data to a text file and converts it into ArrayList<String> form for use in any way
